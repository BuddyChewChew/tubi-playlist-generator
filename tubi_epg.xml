Several months passed with no leads, then an FBI agent took a particular interest in the case.  Using a new technique known as criminal profiling, he predicted that the kidnapper would contact the girl's family on the one-year anniversary of her abduction.  When this prediction came true, the FBI agent noted behavioral clues, hoping that they could lead him to the kidnapper.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250309170000 +0000" stop="20250309180000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>When five-year-old Melissa Brannen disappeared from a Christmas party in December 1989, the only probable suspect was 24-year-old Caleb Hughes.

Fifty blue acrylic fibers collected during a search of Hughes' car, however, became the major piece of evidence in the case.

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250310025000 +0000" stop="20250310034900 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch and Jay double team Luke's bum art; Alice eases Katie's period pain; Glen puts a snowman on ice while Sketch tattoos a butcher who minced his arm off.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250310034900 +0000" stop="20250310044900 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Alice tames Luke's bad cat-too; Sketch does away with Gavin's saucy slogan; Glenn sorts out Hannah's four-letter faux pas; Jay creates a schmokin design for a fireman.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250310044900 +0000" stop="20250310054800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch de-thrones Dan, the self-proclaimed king; Alice cooks up a treat for ex chef Melody and Jay helps Az make a wise choice.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250310054800 +0000" stop="20250310064800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Glen devours Harri's fast food foul-up, while Sketch knocks out boxer Russell's tattoo.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250310064800 +0000" stop="20250310074800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch rids Ben of a silly spooning tattoo; Jay fixes Matt's backside-based chat-up line.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250310074800 +0000" stop="20250310084700 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch and Jay double team Luke's bum art; Alice eases Katie's period pain; Glen puts a snowman on ice while Sketch tattoos a butcher who minced his arm off.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250310084700 +0000" stop="20250310094800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Love is in the air as Glen rids Riley of her Valentine's issues; Jay fixes Leon's bedroom problems; Alice works on Suzanne's cocky Cupid; and Sketch divorces Jordan from his tattoo.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250310094800 +0000" stop="20250310104700 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Two new artists join Sketch, Alice and Paisley to tackle extreme tattoos; Pash gets rid of Ollie's naughty naval tatt, while Uzzi wipes away Brandon's cleaning slip-up; Sketch covers grandad Mick's bold brag; Uzzi tattoos a memorial.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250310104700 +0000" stop="20250310114700 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Alice covers Hannah's shocking memorial to her wild-child years; Uzzi takes on Alan's tribute to an R'n'B star; Sketch rids Kaylee of an obscene arm tattoo; Alice creates a design to celebrate Jane's best friend.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250310114700 +0000" stop="20250310125000 +0000"><title>The Perfect Vagina</title><desc>Lisa Rogers tries to find out why more and more women are considering vaginal surgery for either aesthetic or cultural reasons.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250310125000 +0000" stop="20250310140000 +0000"><title>Addicted to Boob Jobs</title><desc>Journalist Louise Roe investigates why women in the United Kingdom have plastic surgery on their breasts not just once, but multiple times.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250310140000 +0000" stop="20250310145500 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>A lone police officer is violently set upon when he gets called out to two strangers sitting in a woman's parked car on her drive; emergency services have to move swiftly after they find a house doused in petrol and a man threatening to set it.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250310145500 +0000" stop="20250310154700 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>The Squad come face to face with an axe man who's smashed in his neighbor's door, an officer is injured as they try to restrain him and the cops have to use CS gas; a student is arrested after assaulting staff in a pub where he worked.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250310154700 +0000" stop="20250310163800 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Firearms officers and a dog unit race to an address in Nottingham where a man is reported to be blockading his family in a house and threatening to kill them, and a manhunt ensues; bodycam cops chase a car that fails to stop.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250310163800 +0000" stop="20250310173800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool.
